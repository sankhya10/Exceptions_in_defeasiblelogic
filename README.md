# Exceptionsindefeasiblelogic

Project description:

Laws are formulated in natural language, but need to be applied rigorously. One of the problems withthe formalization of 
legal texts using logic is that there is no rule with exceptions. These exceptions can be elegantly treated using default 
implications that capture of the form "normally..." that are implemented in various formalism and systems for default reasoning.

The goal of the project is to formalize subdivision parts of various legislative act. Given the formalization,consistency 
checking and classification should be applied to try to find inconsistenciees or situations that are not dealt with in the
act.
The project should first investigate various frameworks that allow the formalisation of law, and then implement the formal-
-ization given the chosen framework.
